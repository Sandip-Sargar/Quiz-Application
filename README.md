# Quiz-Application
The **Interactive Quiz Application** is a web-based quiz platform that allows users to test their knowledge through multiple-choice questions. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, the app presents a series of questions, each with several answer options. Users select their answers, and immediate feedback is provided, with correct answers highlighted in green and incorrect ones in red. The app keeps track of the user's score, and at the end of the quiz, it displays the total score along with the option to restart the quiz. It uses JavaScript for handling the quiz logic, such as navigation between questions, answer validation, and score calculation. The quiz results are displayed in a simple and intuitive interface, offering a smooth user experience. The app is designed to be lightweight and interactive, making it an excellent tool for testing knowledge on various topics. It can be run locally or hosted on platforms like **GitHub Pages** for public access.
